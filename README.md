Installation
-------------

TBC 

Configuration
-------------

Most configuration will come from the Alerta API server. The minimum,
and most common, configuration is simply to tell the web UI where the
API server is located, using either an environment variable:

    $ export VUE_APP_ALERTA_ENDPOINT=https://alerta-api.example.com

or a `config.json` configuration file in the `dist` directory.

    {
        "endpoint": "https://alerta-api.example.com"
    }

Any setting from the API server can be overridden if included in
the local `config.json` file. For a full list of supported settings
see [web UI config settings documentation][1].

As a special case, support for setting an OAuth Client ID using an
environment variable is possible but should not be be necessary for
most deployments.

    $ export VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID=0ffe5d26-6c66-4871-a6fa-593d9fa972b1
